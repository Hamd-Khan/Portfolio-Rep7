# Java Data Structures and Algorithms Library

This application is a comprehensive collection of data structures and their associated algorithms implemented in Java. This library provides a set of classes for various linear data structures and tree structures.

Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science, and efficient algorithms are essential for working with them effectively. This application aims to simplify the use of common data structures.

#### Linear Data Structures
This section of the library includes implementations of various linear data structures:
Singly Linked List (SLL): A linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence.

Doubly Linked List (DLL): Similar to a singly linked list, but each node points to both the next and the previous node.

Circular Linked List (CSLL): A linked list in which the last node points back to the first node, forming a closed loop.

Circular Doubly Linked List (CDLL): Combines the properties of both a circular linked list and a doubly linked list.

Stack: A linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

Queue: A linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

#### Tree Structures
This section of the library includes implementations of tree-based data structures:

Binary Search Trees (BST): A binary tree in which each node has at most two children, and the values in the left subtree are less than or equal to the value in the node, while the values in the right subtree are greater.

AVL Trees: A self-balancing binary search tree in which the heights of the two child subtrees of every node differ by at most one.
